# Housing Data Analysis

This Jupyter notebook explores a dataset containing housing-related information. It demonstrates fundamental data analysis tasks using Python and pandas, including:

- Reading CSV files and examining the data
- Cleaning and preprocessing missing values
- Performing simple exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Interpreting the dataset through summary statistics

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning with `pandas`
- Data exploration using `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`, and filtering
- Working in Jupyter Notebook

## Note
This project is part of my learning journey toward becoming a data analyst. Future updates will include visualizations and deeper insights.

ðŸ“Š **Next Steps:**
- Add charts using `matplotlib`/`seaborn`
- Add a conclusion or insight section
- Possibly use a larger dataset
